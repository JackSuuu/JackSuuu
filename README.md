### 👋 Hi there, this is Jack

I am a dedicated and detail-oriented technology enthusiast with expertise in Python, Java, and front-end development (HTML/CSS & JavaScript) and UI/UX design. 
Currently expanding my skills in machine learning (PyTorch, Tensorflow) and back-end development with Django.
